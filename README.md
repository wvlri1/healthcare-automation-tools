Sully.ai deploys a comprehensive team of AI employees rather than a single-purpose tool—you get AI scribes, medical coders, receptionists, triage nurses, pharmacists, and researchers working together within your existing systems. The platform's purpose-built medical language model beats GPT-5 across all healthcare benchmarks, achieving 61.17% final accuracy versus GPT-5's 53.55%, with particularly strong performance in diagnosis scenarios where it scores 66.07% compared to GPT-5's 46.63%. This specialized training means Sully understands complex medical terminology and clinical workflows six times faster than alternatives through LPU processing instead of standard GPUs.

Over 400 healthcare organizations trust the platform nationwide, reporting a 72% decrease in burnout and 71% increase in efficiency while serving more patients daily. The AI Scribe automatically transcribes patient conversations into structured clinical notes synchronized with your EHR, while the AI Medical Coder extracts billing codes and ensures compliant claims that cut denials and accelerate reimbursements. AI Receptionists handle patient calls and appointment scheduling with natural conversation capabilities, and AI Nurses manage intake, symptom collection, and triage before visits to improve routing and reduce delays.

**Enterprise security credentials:** HIPAA compliant with SOC 2 Type II certification, ISO 27001 implementation, GDPR data processing, PIPEDA compliance for Canadian privacy requirements, and comprehensive PDL governance controls. The system integrates seamlessly with Epic, Athenahealth, Cerner, CharmHealth, DrChrono, eClinicalWorks, and 50+ additional EHRs without requiring workflow disruption or system replacement.

Doctors remain in full control at all times—the AI agents provide intelligence and execute operational tasks, but clinical decisions stay with licensed professionals. Clinical error rates drop to just 6% when consulting Sully compared to the 40% human physician error rate, while pilots deploy to production in weeks rather than quarters.

## FAQ

**How do these AI platforms handle multi-specialty practices with different documentation requirements?**

Platforms like Sully.ai and DeepScribe offer specialty-specific templates and language models trained on terminology across oncology, cardiology, orthopedics, neurology, and dozens of other disciplines. Suki AI and DAX Copilot provide customizable note structures that adapt to each provider's documentation style while maintaining compliance with specialty-specific billing and regulatory requirements. Configure different workflows, templates, and coding preferences for each specialty within your organization without purchasing separate systems.

**What happens if the AI generates incorrect medical information or billing codes?**

All enterprise AI medical platforms require physician review and approval before finalizing documentation—the AI suggests content and codes, but licensed clinicians make final decisions and edits. Systems like Sully.ai reduce error rates to 6% compared to 40% human error rates, but the technology functions as an assistant rather than replacement. DeepScribe and Abridge allow real-time editing through voice commands or manual input, with version tracking showing what the AI generated versus physician modifications.

**Can these platforms integrate with our existing telehealth and practice management software?**

Most leading platforms including Freed AI, Suki, and DAX Copilot support telehealth recording through web-based interfaces, mobile apps, or direct integration with Zoom, Doxy.me, and other video platforms. Notable Health specifically automates scheduling and intake workflows that connect practice management systems with clinical documentation tools. Verify specific integration capabilities with your vendor during evaluation, as connection methods vary from native APIs to browser extensions to audio file uploads.
